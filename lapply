Have a look at the strsplit() calls, that splits the strings in pioneers on the : sign. The result, split_math is a list of 4 character vectors: the first vector element represents the name, the second element the birth year.
Use lapply() to convert the character vectors in split_math to lowercase letters: apply tolower() on each of the elements in split_math. Assign the result, which is a list, to a new variable split_low.
Finally, inspect the contents of split_low with str().
# The vector pioneers has already been created for you
pioneers <- c("GAUSS:1777", "BAYES:1702", "PASCAL:1623", "PEARSON:1857")

# Split names from birth year
split_math <- strsplit(pioneers, split = ":")
##split_math is a list.##
# Convert to lowercase strings: split_low
split_low<-lapply(split_math,tolower)

# Take a look at the structure of split_low
str(split_low)



Apply select_first() over the elements of split_low with lapply() and assign the result to a new variable names.
Next, write a function select_second() that does the exact same thing for the second element of an inputted vector.
Finally, apply the select_second() function over split_low and assign the output to the variable years.

# Code from previous exercise:
pioneers <- c("GAUSS:1777", "BAYES:1702", "PASCAL:1623", "PEARSON:1857")
split <- strsplit(pioneers, split = ":")
split_low <- lapply(split, tolower)

# Write function select_first()
select_first <- function(x) {
  x[1]
}

# Apply select_first() over split_low: names
names<-lapply(split_low,select_first)

# Write function select_second()
select_second<-function(x){
  x[2]
}






Transform the first call of lapply() such that it uses an anonymous function that does the same thing.
In a similar fashion, convert the second call of lapply to use an anonymous version of the select_second() function.
Remove both the definitions of select_first() and select_second(), as they are no longer useful.

# Definition of split_low
pioneers <- c("GAUSS:1777", "BAYES:1702", "PASCAL:1623", "PEARSON:1857")
split <- strsplit(pioneers, split = ":")
split_low <- lapply(split, tolower)

# Transform: use anonymous function inside lapply
names <- lapply(split_low, function(x){x[1]})

# Transform: use anonymous function inside lapply
years <- lapply(split_low, function(x){x[2]})
