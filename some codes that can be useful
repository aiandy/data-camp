## To compare to vectors(or others) are the same.
identical(x,y)


seq(): Generate sequences, by specifying the from, to and by arguments.
rep(): Replicate elements of vectors and lists.
sort(): Sort a vector in ascending order. Works on numerics, but also on character strings and logicals.
rev(): Reverse the elements in a data structures for which reversal is defined.
str(): Display the structure of any R object.
append(): Merge vectors or lists.
is.*(): Check for the class of an R object.
as.*(): Convert an R object from one class to another.
unlist(): Flatten (possibly embedded) lists to produce a vector.
grepl(), which returns TRUE when a pattern is found in the corresponding character string.
grep(), which returns a vector of indices of the character strings that contains the pattern.

#####examples for grep()#####
# The emails vector has already been defined for you
emails <- c("john.doe@ivyleague.edu", "education@world.gov", "dalai.lama@peace.org",
            "invalid.edu", "quant@bigdatacollege.edu", "cookie.monster@sesame.tv")
# Use grepl() to match for "edu"
grepl("edu",emails)
# Use grep() to match for "edu", save result to hits
hits<-grep("edu",emails)

# Subset emails using hits
emails[hits]

gather(data,key column,name of value column,name of grouping variable)
