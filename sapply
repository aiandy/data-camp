#sapply will return to a vector, lapply will return to a list.
#sapply(X, FUN, ...)
#use str(x) to see the structure
#lapply() and sapply() allow you to use self-defined function and apply them over a vector or list.
#There are things that sapply can't simplified and that would return to a list as the result of lapply if the returned value is a list.

#sapply() and lapply() sometimes creates a NULL.
# Definition of print_info()
print_info <- function(x) {
  cat("The average temperature is", mean(x), "\n")
}

# Apply print_info() over temp using sapply()
sapply(temp,print_info)

# Apply print_info() over temp using lapply()
lapply(temp,print_info)



sapply(list(runif (10), runif (10)), 
       function(x) c(min = min(x), mean = mean(x), max = max(x)))
#(2) This code generates a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns.
#(3) The function that is used inside sapply() is anonymous.
